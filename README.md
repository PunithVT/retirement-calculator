## Built for India's young earners — because nobody else is solving this

India has **~430 million people aged 20–35**, and a record share of them are now in their first salaried job, freelancing, or running side hustles. They want to retire — many even dream of **retiring early (FIRE)**. But almost none of them have a clear answer to the only question that matters:

> _"How much do I actually need to invest **today** so my future self isn't broke at 65?"_

Here's why that question is so hard to answer in India specifically:

- **No social safety net.** Unlike the US or EU, there's no Social Security cheque waiting. Your retirement is **100% your problem.** EPF and NPS help, but rarely cover a real urban lifestyle.
- **Brutal inflation.** Indian CPI averages 6% — but **medical inflation is 10–14%**, education 8–12%, lifestyle creep is real. A ₹50k/month lifestyle today becomes ₹2.7L/month in 25 years.
- **No employer pension.** Less than 12% of Indians work in formal-sector jobs with defined-benefit pensions. The other 88% are on their own.
- **Joint-family safety net is fading.** Urban migration, smaller families, and rising elder-care costs mean you can't count on kids to fund retirement the way the previous generation could.
- **Mainstream advice is bad.** "Just invest in PPF" / "buy LIC" / "12% forever" advice has cost an entire generation of Indians their retirement security.
- **Existing calculators are gated.** Most are sign-up walls for advisory firms that want to sell you PMS, AIF, ULIPs, or insurance. They tell you the corpus number — then ask for your phone number to "discuss further."

**This calculator solves that.** No phone number. No ad retargeting. No upsell. Just enter your numbers and get a brutally honest answer in 30 seconds:

- **How much corpus** you need at retirement (in future rupees, not today's).
- **Whether your current SIP** gets you there — to the year and the rupee.
- **Exactly how much more** to invest each month if it doesn't.
- **The cost of waiting** — what 10 more years of "I'll start next year" will cost you.
- **The Magic Year** — when your money starts earning more than you save (the moment compounding "kicks in").

> **If you are 22–35, earning, and unsure whether your retirement plan will hold — start here. It takes 60 seconds and it's free forever.**

## What is this?

Most online retirement calculators are either **too simplistic** ("assume 12% returns forever, ignore inflation") or buried under **sign-up walls, lead-gen forms, and aggressive upsells** for the parent advisory firm.

This one is different. It asks one blunt question:

> **Given what you save, what you spend, and how long you'll live — does the math actually work?**

If it doesn't, the calculator tells you _exactly_ how much extra you need to invest each month to close the gap. No marketing fluff. No "talk to our advisor." Just numbers.

## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| **Two modes** | SIP (monthly) **or** lumpsum (one-time) — not both bolted on as an afterthought. |
| **Two-phase returns** | Different return assumptions for accumulation (pre-retirement) and withdrawal (post-retirement). Because no sane portfolio looks the same at 35 and 65. |
| **Inflation-aware (twice)** | General expenses inflated at CPI (~6%), **healthcare separately at ~10%** — the silent retirement killer most calculators ignore. |
| **Lifestyle presets** | One-click sliders: Stretched Thin / Tight / Comfortable / Peaceful / Luxurious — pick what your retirement *feels* like, the calculator picks the numbers. |
| **Year-by-year chart** | Canvas-rendered corpus curve with retirement and **Magic Year** markers — you see exactly when compounding takes over. |
| **Shortfall solver** | If your plan fails, a binary search finds the **exact** extra monthly SIP needed to make it work. |
| **Cost of starting late** | Live comparison: what would the same plan cost if you delayed by 10 years? (Spoiler: roughly 2–3× the SIP.) |
| **SIP step-up + annual top-up** | Annual % step-up *and* a fixed yearly top-up (bonuses, RSU vests, tax refunds) — what salaried investors actually do. |
| **Magic Year + Wealth Multiplier** | The age your investment growth first beats your contributions, and how many × your money becomes by retirement. |
| **100% client-side** | No servers, no analytics, no cookies, no fonts loaded from third parties. Refresh and your data is gone. |
| **~30 KB gzipped** | Loads instantly even on patchy 3G. Zero JS dependencies. |
| **Light + dark mode** | Auto-follows `prefers-color-scheme`. |
| **Accessible** | Skip link, ARIA, keyboard navigable, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| **PWA-ready** | Installable on Android/iOS, works offline once visited. |
| **SEO best-in-class** | Semantic HTML, JSON-LD (`WebApplication`, `FAQPage`, `Organization`, `BreadcrumbList`), Open Graph, Twitter cards, sitemap, robots.txt. |

## "How much should I invest?" — quick reference

These are rough **back-of-envelope numbers** for an Indian saver who wants a *comfortable* retirement (₹60k/month general + ₹8k/month healthcare, in today's rupees), retiring at 60, planning to age 85, assuming 12% pre-retirement and 8% post-retirement nominal returns at 6% general inflation + 10% healthcare inflation:

| If you start at age… | Monthly SIP needed | Total invested over working life | Corpus at 60 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **22** | ~₹15,000/mo | ~₹65 L | ~₹6.5 Cr |
| **25** | ~₹20,000/mo | ~₹75 L | ~₹6.5 Cr |
| **28** | ~₹28,000/mo | ~₹95 L | ~₹6.5 Cr |
| **30** | ~₹35,000/mo | ~₹1.1 Cr | ~₹6.5 Cr |
| **35** | ~₹60,000/mo | ~₹1.5 Cr | ~₹6.5 Cr |
| **40** | ~₹1,10,000/mo | ~₹2.2 Cr | ~₹6.5 Cr |

> **Notice the pattern?** The 22-year-old invests **₹65 L total** to retire comfortably. The 40-year-old invests **₹2.2 Cr total** for the *same* outcome. **That ₹1.55 Cr difference is the price of waiting.**
>
> This is why the calculator has a "Cost of starting 10 yrs late" card. Time in the market beats timing the market — and it isn't even close.

The table above assumes no SIP step-up. If you bump your SIP by 5% per year (which most salaried earners can), the required starting SIP drops by **30–40%**.

> **Note:** These are illustrative numbers. **Run your own scenario in the calculator** — change your salary trajectory, your lifestyle, your risk tolerance, your retirement age. The whole point is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer.

## Quick start

It's just static files. **No build step. No npm install. No webpack config to debug.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PunithVT/retirement-calculator.git
cd retirement-calculator

# Pick any of these — they all work:
python3 -m http.server 8000
npx serve .
# Or just open index.html in a browser. That's it.
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## How the math works

The calculator runs a year-by-year simulation in two phases.

### Phase 1 — Accumulation (now → retirement)

```
For each year before retirement:
    corpus = corpus * (1 + pre_return)
    corpus += annual_SIP_contribution     ← grows each year if step-up enabled
```

For lumpsum mode, the contribution is added once at year 0 and then compounded.

### Phase 2 — Withdrawal (retirement → end of life)

```
For each year after retirement:
    annual_expense = today_expense * (1 + inflation) ^ years_from_today
    corpus = corpus * (1 + post_return) - annual_expense
    if corpus < 0: shortfall — record the year you ran out
```

### The shortfall solver

If the plan fails, we **binary search** the additional monthly SIP needed so the corpus survives until your stated life expectancy. The result is the smallest extra contribution that makes your retirement work — accurate to the rupee.

All of this happens in your browser, in milliseconds. See [`app.js`](app.js).

## Privacy-first

This calculator was built on three rules:

1. **No data leaves your device.** All math runs in your browser.
2. **No analytics, no cookies, no third-party fonts, no CDN-hosted scripts.**
3. **No sign-up.** Just open the page and use it.

Open DevTools → Network tab → run a calculation. You'll see _zero_ outbound requests after the initial page load. Verify it yourself.

---

## Why built for India?

Default assumptions and ranges are tuned for Indian investors:

- Inflation default: **6%** (long-term India CPI)
- Pre-retirement return: **11–12%** (equity-heavy mutual fund/NIFTY 50 historicals)
- Post-retirement return: **7–9%** (debt-tilted balanced portfolio)
- Currency: **₹** (INR), Indian numbering (lakhs / crores)
- Locale: `en-IN`

That said, **the math works for any country.** Override the defaults and it's a global retirement calculator.

---

## Tech stack

- **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** Zero dependencies. Zero build tools.
- **Single page**, ~25 KB gzipped total payload.
- **Canvas chart** rendered by hand — no Chart.js, no D3, no React.
- **PWA** via `manifest.json` and a minimal service worker.
- **Semantic HTML5** with full ARIA support.

Why no framework? Because this is a calculator, not a SaaS product. Every dependency is a liability — for security, for load time, for the next maintainer. Plain web platform features got us 95+ on PageSpeed without breaking a sweat.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for non-Indian retirement planning?**
Yes. The math is universal. Just override the inflation, return, and currency-format defaults to suit your region.

**Q: Is there an API?**
No. This is a fully client-side calculator and there's no server. If you want to embed it, fork the repo and host your own copy.

**Q: How accurate is it?**
The arithmetic is exact. The _accuracy_ depends entirely on your inputs — assumed returns, inflation, and life expectancy are estimates, not predictions. Use conservative numbers and always over-save.

**Q: Why no Monte Carlo?**
On the roadmap. The deterministic version is what most users actually need; Monte Carlo is for the curious. Both will live in the same page when shipped.

**Q: Why is this open source?**
Because retirement math shouldn't be locked behind a sign-up form, and because verified-by-anyone code is more trustworthy than a black box.
